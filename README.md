# Dyslexic-Handwriting-Recognition
It is a Image Recognition model which can read sentences written by a Dyslexic person and then correct it to produce a readable result.

The Dataset used is from - https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database
I recomment using a VPN to create an account to access the website.

The algorithm used is currently PyTesseract. Any changes will be updated accordingly.
